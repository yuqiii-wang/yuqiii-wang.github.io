# Redis Example Uses

## Practices

Remote connect (Do not use `-a` if there is sensitive data concerned):
```bash
redis-cli -h ${host} -p ${port} -a ${password}
```

Populate data:
```bash
# run four times
4 INCR visit

HMSET visit:1 url www.baidu.com timestamp 1 country CN user_id 1
HMSET visit:2 url www.baidu.com timestamp 1 country CN user_id 2
HMSET visit:3 url www.google.com timestamp 3 country CN user_id 3
HMSET visit:4 url www.google.com timestamp 4 country US user_id 4

ZADD visit-timestamp 1 visit:1
ZADD visit-timestamp 1 visit:2
ZADD visit-timestamp 3 visit:3
ZADD visit-timestamp 4 visit:4

ZADD visit.timestamp.index 1 1
ZADD visit.timestamp.index 3 2
ZADD visit.timestamp.index 4 3

# Verify the populated data
ZRANGE visit-timestamp 0 999
```

```bash
FT.AGGREGATE visit.timestamp.index "*"
  APPLY "@timestamp - (@timestamp % 3600)" AS hour
  
  GROUPBY 1 @hour
  	REDUCE COUNT_DISTINCT 1 @user_id AS num_users
  	
  SORTBY 2 @hour ASC
```

## Project-wise Solution

### Autocomplete

In the web world, autocomplete is a method that allows us to quickly look up things that
we want to find without searching. Generally, it works by taking the letters that weâ€™re
typing and finding all words that start with those letters.

* Solution:

Use `LIST` to push/pop to add/remove recent searched words; Each item is a `String` so that substring compare can be used to match prefix.

### Cloud distributed locks

In Cloud app development, services are micro modules interacting with each other. There should be locks to prevent service-level concurrency.

* Solution:

Use `String` to set bool value to indicate if there is a lock. See Redlock for reference.

### Tick data streaming

Redis can be used to streaming data by `subscribe` and `publish`.

A client can subscribe a channel named `A-Share-Index`
```bash
SUBSCRIBE A-Share-Index
```

A message sender can publish messages on a channel
```bash
PUBLISH A-Share-Index 3000
PUBLISH A-Share-Index 2999
PUBLISH A-Share-Index 2998
```

### JSON data handling

Use RedisJSON; RedisJSON is a module that provides a special datatype and direct manipulation commands. RedisJSON stores the data in a binary format which removes the storage overhead from JSON, provides quicker access to elements without de-/re-serialization times.

Example:
```bash
JSON.SET car:1 $ '{"colour":"blue","make":"saab","model":93,"features":["powerlocks","moonroof"]}'
```

### Time series data handling

Handle time series by `ZSET`. However, `ZSET` only allows unique values. We can add entropy appending to least significant digits, such as Celsius $21.0$ turned into $21.0000017643$
```bash
# ZADD temperature(key) timestamp(ms) degree(Celsius)
ZADD temperature 1511533205001 21.0000017643
ZADD temperature 1511533206001 21.0000091264
ZADD temperature 1511533207001 21.0000045398
```
