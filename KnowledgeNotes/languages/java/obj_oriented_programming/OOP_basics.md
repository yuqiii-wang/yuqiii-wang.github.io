# Some Basic OOP Concepts

* Four fundemantal OOP concepts

Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.

* Where to place methods

By business logic, class methods should be closely attached (put inside) to the class in which most expected changing attributes are associated with the class.

* Data Hiding (Encapsulation)

Remember to use setXXX() and getXXX() to set and get class member values which should be private.

* Single Inheritance

Java only allows for single inheritance (by `extends`), and this is recommended. Cpp permits multiple inheritance.

* IS-A vs HAS-A

In object-oriented programming, the concept of **IS-A** is a totally based on **Inheritance**, which can be of two types Class Inheritance or Interface Inheritance. It is just like saying "A is a B type of thing".

Composition(**HAS-A**) simply mean the use of instance variables that are **references to other objects**. For example Maruti has Engine, or House has Bathroom.
