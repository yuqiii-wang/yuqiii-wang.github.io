# IMU

An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers. 

Typically, it provides
linear and angular accelerations
$$
[a_x, a_y, a_z, a_{\theta_{yaw}}, a_{\theta_{pitch}}, a_{\theta_{roll}}]
$$

By taking interal over acceleration, linear and angular velocities can be expressed as
$$
[v_x, v_y, v_z, v_{\theta_{yaw}}, v_{\theta_{pitch}}, v_{\theta_{roll}}]
$$

By taking interal over acceleration, distance and angle can be expressed as
$$
[d_x, d_y, d_z, \theta_{yaw}, \theta_{pitch}, \theta_{roll}]
$$
