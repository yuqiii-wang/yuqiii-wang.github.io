# Chi-squared distribution

chi-squared distribution (also chi-square or $X^2$-distribution) with $k$ degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables. 

If $Z_1, ..., Z_k$ are independent, standard normal random variables, then the sum of their squares,
$$
Q = \sum^k_{i=1} Z^2_i
