# Group

A group is a set equipped with an *operation* that combines *any two elements* of the *set* to produce *a third element* of the set, in such a way that the operation is associative, an identity element exists and every element has an inverse. 

## Commutator

The commutator of two elements, $g$ and $h$, of a group $G$, is the element
$$
[g, h] = g^{−1}h^{−1}gh.
$$
This element is equal to the group's identity if and only if $g$ and $h$ commute (from the definition $gh = hg [g, h]$, being $[g, h]$ equal to the identity if and only if $gh = hg$).


## Function Composition

Function composition is an operation $\cdot$ that takes two functions $f$ and $g$, and produces a function $h = g \cdot f$ such that $h(x) = g(f(x))$
