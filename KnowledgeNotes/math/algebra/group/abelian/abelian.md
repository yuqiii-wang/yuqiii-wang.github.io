# Abelian

An abelian group, also called a commutative group, is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written.

Define a set $A$, together with an operator $\cdot$ (typically addition $+$ or multiplication $\times$) that combines any two elements $a$ and $b$ of $A$ to form another element of $A$, denoted $a \cdot b$

An abelian group follows *commutativity*:
$$
\forall a, b \in A, a \cdot b = b \cdot a
$$
