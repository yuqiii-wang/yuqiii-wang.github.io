# Design Thinking

## Elements of Design Thinking

1. **WHO**: think about who will be the end users, and go deep into the characteristics (customer persona) of the user group. Try to develop a representative model of this group of customers.

2. **WHAT**: Understand the problems that the group of customers are facing, and disect the problems.

3. **HOW**: Leverage intelligence to address the identified problems. Analyse the costs and expected returns/deliverables. Present the collective wisdom as a holistic solution.

## Back and Forth Validation

Generated ideas upon observations and analysis should be prototyped and tested, then go back for re-analysis. This process should run a few cycles before final execution on full scale.
