## Canary Testing

**Canary Testing** is a way to reduce risk and validate new software by releasing software to a small percentage of users. 

## Blue-Green Deployment

Blue green deployment is an application release model that gradually transfers user traffic from a previous version of an app or microservice to a nearly identical new releaseâ€”both of which are running in production. 

The old version can be called the blue environment while the new version can be known as the green environment.
