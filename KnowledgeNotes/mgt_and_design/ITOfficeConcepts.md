## Active Directory (AD)

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks.Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.

For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user.

## Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (ADLDS)

AD LDS is a mode of Active Directory that provides directory services for applications, minus a number of features such as infrastructure management. 

## Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)

Application lifecycle management (ALM) is the product lifecycle management (governance, development, and maintenance) of computer programs.

Jira is a proprietary issue tracking product developed by Atlassian that allows bug tracking and agile project management.
