# Ethereum

**Ethereum** is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.

**Ether** (ETH or Îž) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. 

There are **two types of accounts** on Ethereum: user accounts (also known as externally-owned accounts) and contracts. Both types have an ETH balance.

The **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is the runtime environment for transaction execution in Ethereum.

**Gas** is a unit of account within the EVM used in the calculation of a transaction fee,

In October 2015, a development governance was proposed as the **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)**.

**Ethereum's smart contracts** are written in high-level programming languages and then compiled down to EVM bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.

A **Provider** abstracts a connection to the Ethereum blockchain, for issuing queries and sending signed state changing transactions.
